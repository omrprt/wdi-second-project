# Project #2: A Full-stack Application

### Overview

The second project is to **build a full-stack RESTful application** that includes **authentication**.

You'll be **building an Express application** that has a **Mongo** database using the **Mongoose ORM**.

We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project. Sketch some wireframes before you start and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code!

Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** – one representing a user and one that represents the main resource of your app, e.g. Restaurants
* **Incude relationships** - embedded or referenced. Make sure you take the time to consider the best approach before building out your models.
* **The app should include authentication** - with hashed passwords & an authorization flow.
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with all CRUD actions.
* **You must use SCSS** - as this is a key industry skill.
* **You should use a CSS framework that has a grid system** - even if the grid is the only part you use from the framework, it is fundamental that you get to grips with rows and columns.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

### Bonus
* **Include data from an API** - to make your app more dynamic, add some data from an API. You might need to consider CORS issues with AJAX and/or the need to store this external data in your app.

> **Note:** It might be tempting to base your project around a specific API, however as external APIs are out of our control, and often it can take a few days before you get granted a key, any API use for this module should be a bonus on top of your RESTful app. An example would be a travel blog app that also uses a weather API to show the current temperature/conditions at that location.

### Extra considerations

* Have you added client-side form validation using the built in HTML validation, or the jQuery validate plugin?
* Have you added flash messages to show success/error information?
* Have you added some seeds so that you can populate your database on Heroku?

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application** - hosted on Heroku.
* A **link to your hosted working app** - in the URL section of your Github repo.
* A **git repository hosted on Github** - with a link to your hosted project and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
* **A `readme.md` file** - with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* **Wireframes of your app** - hosted somewhere & linked in your `readme.md`.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories and/or wireframes define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what ot build.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you plan your app using wireframes? Did you use Trello to keep track of your tasks? Did you use source control (git) as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Deployment and Functionality__: Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?
